<center><h3> <p> “My favorite ring? I’ve always said the next one." - Tom Brady</p> </h3> </center>



<p> I am a die hard Boston sports fan. Basketball is my favorite sport to watch so I follow the Celtics and the entire NBA. I became a fan of the Celtics, Red Sox, Bruins, and Patriots from my dad, who also grew up in Kennebunk and lived in Massachusetts for a lot of his life. My family owns a seating company called Hussey Seating that does spectator seating all around the world. We own the seats in Gilette Stadium so I've been lucky enough to attend a lot of Patriots games throughout the years. Many stadiums all throughout the U.S. are Hussey seats, such as the Denver Broncos, Denver Nuggets, Tennessee Titans, Nashville Predators, and many more. It's been an absolute privilege to grow up owning a family business.
