<p> Nothing beats traveling, whether it's going to another state, or another country. I've been lucky enough to leave the country on multiple occasions, and each time has been a lot of fun. Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean are the big three I've been to. In Canada we stopped in Toronto to catch some Red Sox vs. Blue Jays games, in Mexico we visited a resort in Cancun for a vacation, and lastly my entire family went on a cruise of the caribbean. We stopped at four islands, a couple of them pictured below. I am also lucky enough to visit North Haven Island, off of Rockland, Maine every summer to hang out with the Hussey Family. </p>
